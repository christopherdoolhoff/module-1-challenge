# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This project was starter code that I used to practice my coding skills in HTML and CSS. I learned that if you take the time to familiarize yourself with an unfamiliar code, you can understand it and make changes to it in a variety of positive ways. I fixed a link that did not work, I added notes to understand the code better, and I combined repetitive code. I was really fun to realize how much of the code I understood after just a week of working in a coding bootcamp.

## Credits

The starter code was provided by the UCF bootcamp
